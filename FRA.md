## Long-term Liabilities

1. Bond amortization schedule
   1. 【重要】$BV_t = BV_{t-1} + Interest\ expense - Coupon\ payments$
      1. $$Interest\ expense=BV_{t-1} * Effective\ market rate$$
      2. $Coupon\ payments = Coupon\ rate * Par\ Value$
      3. $$Amortization = Interest\ expense - Coupon\ payments$$
      4. For analysis purpose, the interest expense and the amortization of the premium should be separated
   
2. Cash flow of bond

   2. Market rate > Coupon rate (Discount bond)
      1. Interest decreases overtime，由于bond在不断的趋向于Par value
      2. CFO is overstate,and CFF is understate.(Carrying value of bond on balance sheet)

      | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
      | 判断            | 1. BV > Recovarable amount，要减值可收回金额；<br />2. Higher<br />**Value in use** <br />**NRV = selling price -selling cost** | 1. BV > Undiscounted/Expeced future cash flow |
      | 减值到          | **recoverable amount**                                       | **fair value**                                |
      | Impairment loss | Impariment loss = Carrying value - Recoverable amount        | Impariment loss = Carrying value - Fair value |
      | 转回            | 可以转回，以减值金额为限                                     | 不可以转回                                    |

      

   2. Held for sale

      1. Held for use --> Held for sale --> impariment test

   |      | The lower of the cost or **net realizable value(NRV)**       | Inv is the lower of the cost or market.                      |
   | 判断 | If cost >NRV<br />1. Inventory is written down to NRV on B/S；<br />2. A loss is recognized in I/S（COGS↑） | 1. If Replacement cost（重置成本）> NRV<br />**Market = NRV<br />**2. If Replacement cost < NRV - Normal profit margin<br />**Market = NRV - Normal profit margin**<br />3. If NRV - Normal profit margin < Replacement cost < NRV<br />**Market = Replacement cost** |
   | 转回 | a. Reversal limited to the amout of the original write-down<br />b. Is allowed and a gain is recognized in I/S (COGS↓) | 不能转回                                                     |

   **Inventory in US GAAP**

   	* Inventory is written down to market on B/S
   	* A loss is recognized in I/S
   	* No subsequent(随后的) reversal is allowed

   **Impact of inventory adjustments**

   1. 如下四类产品以NRV计量

      * Agriculturual

      * Forest products

      * Minerals

      * Commodities

   2. **Any gain or losses resulting** from changing in value should be **recognized in I/S both under IFRS and US GAAP.**

3. Analysis on Inventory

   1. **LIFO reserve**
      1. LIFO reserve = FIFO inventory - LIFO inventory

   2. **LIFO & FIFO conversion**
      1. Income statement changes
         1. $COGS_{LIFO} - COGS_{FIFO}=\Delta LIFO\ reserve $
         2. $NI_{FIFO} - NI_{LIFO} = \Delta LIFO\ reserve*(1-tax\ rate)$

      2. Balance sheet changes
         1. $INV_{FIFO} - INV_{LIFO} = LIFO\ reserve$
         2. $R/E_{FIFO} - R/E_{LIFO} = LIFO reserve_{Ending}*(1-Tax\ rate)$
         3. $Cash_{LIFO} - Cash_{FIFO} = LIFO reserve_{Ending}*Tax\ rate$

   3. LIFO liquidation
      1. 定义：Q进 < Q出
      2. COGS被低估（卖老货，吃老本），COGS no longer reflects recent prices.
      3. If P上升，LIFO reserve may decline.
      4. 分析师调整--识别.

4. 存货需要报告和披露（GAAP & IFRS）

   1. Cost flow method used；
   2. Total carrying amount of inventories;
   3. Disclose the carrying value of inventory which is valued at net realizable value;
   4. COGS for the period;
   5. The amount of inventory write-down;
   6. The amount of reversal of inventory write-down and the events or circumstances of reversal(IFRS only).
