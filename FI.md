## Understanding FI Risk and Return
1. Source of return
   1. Promised **coupon** and **principal payments**
   2. **Reinvestment of coupon payments**
   3. **Capital gain or loss **on the sale of bond prior to maturity.
2. Interest rate risk on fixed-rate bond investment
   1. 利率影响票息在投资和bond market price
   2. market price matters more 如果投资者有一个短期的投资期间
   3. coupon reinvestment risk matters more when the investor has a long-term investment horizon.
3. **Duration**
   有两种类型的债券久期；收益率久期和曲线久期。收益率久期定义为债券价格对其到期收益率的敏感性。另一方面，曲线久期被定义为债券价格对基准收益率曲线（如政府收益率曲线、即期曲线或远期曲线）的敏感性。然而，政府面值曲线是最常用的。收益率久期统计数据是麦考利久期、修正久期、美元久期和基点价格值 (PVBP)。
   1. Yield duration 收益率久期 
      1. 定义：**Sensitivity of bond price** to the bond's own YTM.
      2. Macaulay duration 麦考利久期
         1. 麦考利久期是投资者通过息票和本金偿还收回投资于债券的资金所花费的时间。它试图衡量投资者从债券的总现金流中收回债券价格所需的年数。
         2. MacDur is measured in terms of time periods.
         3. $$MacDur = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^n t * PVCF_t}{\sum PVCF_t}$$
         4. 对于永续债券：MacDur = (1+r)/r
         5. 对于零息债券，MacDur = maturity，只有一笔现金流就是他的期限。
      3. Modified duration
         1. Modified duration: requires a simple adjustment to Macaulay duration.
         2. $$ModDur = \frac{MacDur}{1+r}$$
         3. <b> r: yield per period</b>
         4. $$\% \Delta Price \approx -ModDur * \Delta Yield $$
      4. Approximate modified duration
         1. 近似修正久期: an alternative approach to calculate modified duration.
         2. $$ApproxModDur = \frac{P_- - P_+}{2*(\Delta Yield) * P_0}$$
      5. ApproxMacDur = ApproxModDur * (1+r)
      5. Money duration
         1. 定义：a measure of the price change in units of currency given a change in its YTM.
         2. $$MoneyDur = ModDur * Price(full)$$
         3. **MoneyDur per 100 units of par value = Moddur * Price(Full) of bond per 100 of par value.**
      6. Price value of a basis point(PVBP) 
         1. 定义：the money change in full price of a bond when its YTM changes by one basis point(0.01%).
         2. $$PVBP = \frac{P_- - P_+}{2}$$
   2. **Curve duration**
      1. 定义：**Senstivity of bond price to a benchmark yield curve.**
      2. Effective duration 有效久期
      3. $$EffDur = \frac{P_- - P_+}{2 * (\% \Delta Curve) * P_0}$$
      4. 用途：
         1. Measures interest rate risk in terms of a **parallel shif** in the benchamrk yield curve(△Curve).
         2. Used for bonds **with embedded option due to uncertain future cash flow and absence of well-defined IRR(YTM).**
   3. Key rate duration/partial duration 关键久期、部分久期（Sensitivity to yield at specific maturity）--非平移
   4. Properties of bond duration 债券的期限特性
      1. Longer time-to-maturity usually leads to higher duration.
      2. Higher coupon rate leads to lower duration.
      3. Higher yield-to-maturity leads to lower duration.
      4. Embedded call option 
         1. r下降，导致更低的久期
      5. Embedded put option 
         1. r升高，导致更低的久期
   5. Bond portfolio duration(two methods)
      1. method1: the weighted average of time to receipt of the aggregate cash flow.
      2. method2: the weighted average of the individual bond durations
         1. $$Portfolio\ duration = w_1D_1 + w_2D_2 + ... + w_nD_n$$
         2. Limitations: implicitly **assume a parallel shif** in the yield curve.
4. Convexity
   1. 久期是价格相对于利率的敏感度，凸度是久期相对于利率的敏感度。
   2. The "second-order" effect of the price-yield curve.
   3. $$\%\Delta Price^{Full} \approx (-ModDur*\Delta Yield) + [\frac{1}{2}*Con*(\Delta Yield)^2]$$
   4. $$ApproxCon = \frac{P_- + P_+ - 2P_0}{(\Delta Yield)^2 * P_0}$$
5. Money convexity 美元凸度
   1. $$MoneyCon = Convexity * Price^{Full}$$
6. Effective convexity 有效凸度
   1. 定义：Is a curve convexity statistic that measures the second-order effect of a change in a benchmark yield curve.
   2. $$EffCon = \frac{P_- + P_+ - 2P_0}{P_0 * (\Delta Curve)^2}$$
   3. **Callable bonds** often have **negative convexity**,especially when interest rates are **low**.
   4. **Putable bonds** often have higher **positive convexity**, especially when interest rates are **high**.
7. Benefits of greater convexity
   1. The more convex bond outperforms the less convex bond 涨多跌少
8. Properties of bond convexity
   1. The factors that leads to greater convexity are the same as for duration.
      1. Longer time-to-maturity
      2. Lower coupon rate
      3. Lower yield-to-maturity
   2. For bonds with same duration,现金流越分散，凸度越大。
9.  Interest rate risk
    1.  Term structure of yield volatility(波动利率的期限结构)
        1.  The bond price changes are products of two factors
            1.  $$\% \Delta Price \approx -ModDur * \Delta Yield $$
        2.  Shorter-term bond may have more price volatility than a long-term bond because of higher yield volatility.
    2. The investment horizon for which coupon reinvestment risk and market price risk offset each other.
    3. Duration gap
       1. DG = MacDur - Investment horizon
          1. DG < 0,reinvestment dominates market price risk.
          2. DG > 0,market price risk dominates reinvestment risk.
10. Credit and liquidity spread 信用流动性利差

## Fundamentals of Credit Analysis
1. Credit risk and credit rating
   1. Default risk/default probability
   2. Loss severity/Loss given default
   3. Expected Loss = Default probability * Loss severity
   4. Recovery rate 
      1. Loss severity(损失严重程度) = 1 - Recovery rate
2. Credit-related risk
   1. Spread risk
      1. Credit migration risk信用迁移风险/downgrade risk降级风险
      2. Market liquidity risk
   2. Seniority ranking 资历排名
   3. Notching 评级微调
3. Risks in relying on agency ratings
   1. credit ratings can be very dynamic
   2. not infallible(不靠谱)
   3. lag market pricing
   4. 特殊的事件风险
4. Credit analysis
   1. 4C
      1. Capacity 能力
      2. Collateral 抵押物
      3. Covenants 条款
      4. Character 质量分析
   2. Yield spread
      1. Yield spread = Credit spread + liquidity premium
   3. Special consideration in credit analysis
   4. High yield debt
   5. Sovereign debt
   6. Municipal debt 市政债务
